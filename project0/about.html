            Hello! My name is Adam and I'm currently 31 years old.
            I'm working currently as Localization Engineer Lead.
            In my spare time I'm trying to develop my programming skills. My favorite language is python!
            Besides programming and I like computer games, mainly multiplayer ones.

            Bonus: My lovely birds! Canary called "Kojak" and budgie called "Lenka". :)</br></br>
