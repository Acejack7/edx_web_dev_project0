        <span>When I was 13 (so around 18 years ago...) I found a HTML tutorial in CD-Action - one of the polish magazines about computer games.
            I found it very funny that a few lines of text can change how website looks. Fast forward, after trying differnt things in life,
            I decided to learn coding more deeply. I touched Javascript with HTML5 and CSS but I discovered the real love to coding when I met with Python. :)
