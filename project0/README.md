# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This simple website describes myself and a few things of my life. You can find information where I am occupied, what are my interests and what I like in general. :)
The project contain following files:
index.html -> main page, contains the menu and iframe - place, where all the subpages will appear after click
placeholder.html -> the initial file in iframe showed in index.html with welcome message and a budgie photo
about.html -> a few details about me like age or occupation and hobbies. Also you can find a photo of my pets!
games.html -> short summary of what games I play or played recently, inserted in a table
python.html -> information about python language - how I started learning this language and what modules I used
job.html -> more details about my occupation
style.scss -> scss file for all html files from above. It contains whole page styling.

Every subpage uses menu from index.html. I used iframe to show all the pages in one place but I'm not sure if it suit modern web development. ;)
